# Call for Papers
Our workshop is **nonarchival**, the accepted papers will be posted on our website. 
Our workshop calls for high-quality and cutting-edge paper submissions in the following two tracks:

## Original Research/Position/Attention/Education Track

This track calls for 4-8 page paper (with unlimited references and appendices) of high-quality contributions from AI applications to all fields of scientific discovery, ranging from physics, biology, chemistry, earth science, environmental science, mechanical science, aerospace science, management science, agricultural science, material science, nuclear science etc. Appendix is optional, but reviewers are not required to read. 

Example topics include (but not limited to):
- Learning from acoustics
- Learning physical dynamics from data
- Speeding up physical simulators, samplers and solvers
- Molecular modeling and de novo generation
- Modeling biological systems, genomics, protein, RNA 
- Accelerating cosmological simulations
- Improving crop yields through precision agriculture
- Optimizing aerospace product design and development
- Benchmarking related or new tasks (i.e., datasets, sota models, etc.)
- Building tools/infrastructures/platforms for scientific discovery
- Study of science of science/scientific methods

# Submission Instructions

All submissions are managed through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/AI4Science).

The review process is double-blind so the submission should be anonymized. We welcome submissions that are (1) originally unpublished, (2) recently published in science journals, or (3) work-in-progress.
We use [the NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX template](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip). Please change the footnote to Submitted to/Accepted at/Published in the AI for Science workshop (NeurIPS 2025).
Accepted papers would be archived on the workshop website. Contributed talks and best paper awards would be given based on review scores and chairs discussion.
