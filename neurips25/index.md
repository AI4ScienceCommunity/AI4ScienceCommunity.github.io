# About

In the evolving landscape of scientific research, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with scientists offers an opportunity to empower scientific research and eventually lead to Nobel prize worthy discoveries made by AI. A notable example is the development of large language models (LLMs), which build interactive interfaces between humans and AI through language. This has led to their adoption in science, including the use of AI agents to create autonomous workflows for scientific discovery. **We welcome submissions from all AI for Science areas, but we concentrate some of our talks and panels on scaling in AI for Science**. The main objectives include

1. **Showcasing Successful AI-Scientist Collaborations**
   - Analyze and present successful partnerships between AI and scientists across various scientific fields.
   - Understand collaboration levels and discuss the potential for autonomous AI systems in scientific research.

2. **Hosting Research Debates on AI and Human Roles**
   - Facilitate debates on the roles of scientists and AI in the stages of scientific discovery.
   - Focus on distinguishing contributions between AI and human scientists.
   - Identify optimal collaboration conditions for maximal benefits.

3. **Addressing Ethical Issues and Regulation**
   - Critically examine ethical concerns related to AI in scientific research.
   - Propose regulatory solutions to mitigate risks such as generating malicious content, biased decision-making, and the misuse of AI.
   - Ensure ethical, safe, and regulated use of AI in scientific settings.

4. **Exploring AI in Education**
   - Explore opportunities for using AI to democratize access to advanced scientific knowledge.
   - Discuss how AI can enhance scientific education and training.
   - Make scientific knowledge more accessible to non-experts.

## Submissions 

Please submit your paper in Openreview. Our workshop is **nonarchival**, the accepted papers will be posted on our website. 

## Frequent Q&A

- What is the abstract deadline and why do we have it?
- You only need to create a submission tab on OpenReview by the abstract deadline. (**This is not a separate submission track for short papers**). As we receive a large volume of diverse submissions, to entire good review quality and coverage of reviewer areas, we keep an abstract deadline for us to have a chance to invite new reviewers if needed.

- Can I attend the workshop even if I don't have any submissions?
- Yes, you are welcome to attend the workshop. Registration is through NeurIPS 2025 registration system with workshop selected. 

- Can I join the organizing team?
- We always welcome new members to join our organizing team, feel free to reach out to us if you are interested. Several questions are recommended to be answered to help us make decision: what do you like about the workshop? what do you think we should improve? what can you contribute to the organizing team?
