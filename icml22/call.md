# Call for Papers

 We will have three tracks of submissions:

- ** Original Research Track**, where we welcome any original studies using AI/ML to tackle problems from all science subjects;

- ** Attention Track**,  where we want to hear from your thoughts what might be the gaps, unrealistic methods or unreal treads in the current AI+Science research;

- ** Highlight Track**, where we expect to hear your comprehensive survey/benchmark on a specific topic under AI4Science, e.g., ML for Molecules, comparing with the original track, this track is more focused on the  are more interested in summarising the published works. 


# Submission Instructions

We've opened a [venue](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2022/Workshop/AI4Science) on OpenReview to handle all the submissions.

Submissions should have 4-8 pages for the main text, using the ICML style file and can have unlimited space for the appendix. All accepted papers will be non-archival, and each submission will be rigorously assigned to at least 2-3 reviewers in a double-blind manner. We will use mechanisms provided by the OpenReview to handle any conflicts of interest appropriately.
