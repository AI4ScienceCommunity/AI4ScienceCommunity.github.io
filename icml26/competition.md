# AI Scientist Competition Overview

AI has crossed an inflection point from passive assistant to active agent that can generate hypotheses, design experiments, and execute them end-to-end. Yet the term “AI Scientist” now covers systems that behave as tools, co-authors, or near-founders—with little shared vocabulary to distinguish them. Our competition invites the community to define this frontier through ambitious dataset proposals and AI scientist system blueprints, each limited to **two pages of main text** (unlimited references/appendices).

Winning teams will share **$10K in prizes sponsored by Xaira Therapeutics**, receive spotlight presentations at the workshop, and help shape the standards for trustworthy autonomous discovery.

## Tracks

### Dataset Generation Track
- **Goal:** Propose openly shareable datasets that unlock fundamental progress in any scientific domain.
- **What to cover:** scientific question(s), data modalities, acquisition pipelines (experimental, computational, or hybrid), annotation/metadata plans, and how the dataset will accelerate downstream AI models.
- **Evaluation:** scientific importance, originality, feasibility of collection, openness, safety/privacy considerations, and clarity of the roadmap for future model development.

### AI Scientist Track
- **Goal:** Describe AI systems capable of autonomous or semi-autonomous scientific discovery, including hypothesis generation, literature synthesis, experiment design, simulation, verification, and cross-domain reasoning.
- **What to cover:** system architecture, scope of autonomy, evaluation protocols, safeguards, and paths to deployment in real labs.
- **Evaluation:** breadth and depth of scientific workflows supported, technical feasibility, rigor of benchmarking methodology, and potential scientific impact.

## Submission Guidelines
- **Length:** 2 pages main text (PDF), unlimited references/appendices.
- **Format:** ICML 2026 style file (double-blind submission mode); update the template footnote to “Submitted to the AI for Science workshop (ICML 2026).”
- **Anonymity:** Double blind; remove identifying information and external artifacts that reveal author identity.
- **Review:** At least two expert reviewers plus an area chair; conflicts handled via OpenReview. Best proposal awards announced during closing remarks.

## Timeline (Anywhere on Earth)
- Submission deadline: **April 24, 2026 (AoE)**
- Notification deadline: **May 15, 2026 (AoE)**
- Camera-ready + spotlight material: **May 29, 2026 (AoE)**
- In-person presentations: **Workshop day at ICML 2026 (July, exact date TBA)**
