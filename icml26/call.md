# Call for Papers
Our workshop is **nonarchival** so authors retain the right to publish the work elsewhere. We seek cutting-edge stories of autonomous discovery, co-creative workflows, and responsible deployment across four submission tracks.

## (A) Original Research Track

Submit 4–8 page papers (unlimited references/appendices) describing new algorithms, systems, or scientific findings enabled by AI. We welcome work spanning physics, chemistry, biology, climate, engineering, and the social or management sciences. Appendices may include implementation details, but reviewers are not required to read them.

Example topics include (but not limited to):
- Closed-loop design-build-test workflows and autonomous labs
- Multiscale modeling of molecules, materials, or climate systems
- Generative models for catalysts, battery materials, or biological sequences
- Scientific reasoning agents that incorporate symbolic, causal, or geometric priors
- New benchmarks or datasets for evaluating AI scientists

## (B) Attention Track

This 4–8 page track spotlights position papers that articulate the opportunities and risks of AI-driven science. Bring forward missing perspectives, community recommendations, and informed critiques.

Example topics include (but not limited to):
- Policies for credit assignment and authorship with AI collaborators
- Practical guidance for responsible deployment in physical labs
- Opportunities at the intersection of disciplines that rarely meet
- Future research agendas for sociotechnical governance


## (C) Highlight Track

This 4–8 page track features surveys, benchmarks, or synthesis work that consolidates progress on a specific AI4Science topic (agents for experimental planning, lab robotics, etc.). Compared with the original track, highlight papers emphasize lessons from existing literature rather than brand-new experiments.

Example topics include (but not limited to):
- Benchmark suites for cooperative human–AI scientific teams
- Lessons from AI-assisted drug discovery campaigns
- Comparative studies of autonomous experimentation platforms
- Evaluations of agent-based scientific reasoning

## (D) Education Track 

The community needs high-quality, open educational resources to keep pace with rapid advances. We invite tutorials, curricula, notebooks, or review papers (again 4–8 pages plus unlimited appendices) that lower the barrier for students and practitioners who want to build AI scientists. If you submit multimedia content such as code labs, include a short written overview that explains the intended audience and learning outcomes.

## Dataset Proposal Competition

For the dataset proposal competition details, please visit [this page](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/icml26/dataset.html). (The instructions below only apply to the research, attention, highlight, and education tracks.)

# Important Dates (Anywhere on Earth)

- Abstract Submission Deadline: Mar 13, 2026
- Paper Submission Deadline: Mar 16, 2026
- Review Bidding Period: Mar 20–22, 2026

# Submission Instructions

All submissions are managed through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2026/Workshop/AI4Science).

The review process is double blind, so please remove identifying information from the main paper and supplementary files. Submissions may include work in progress, previously unpublished results, or recently published science-journal articles that you would like to bring to the ICML audience.

We will use the official ICML 2026 style files (link forthcoming from the conference). Please change the template footnote to “Submitted to/Accepted at/Published in the AI for Science workshop (ICML 2026).” Accepted papers will be posted on this website, and a subset will be invited for spotlight or contributed talks based on reviewer and organizer recommendations.
