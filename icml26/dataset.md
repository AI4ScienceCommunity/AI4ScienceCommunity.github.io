# Dataset Proposal Competition

Scientific breakthroughs often follow the arrival of ambitious, openly shared datasets: think of the Protein Data Bank, ImageNet, and the explosion of high-resolution Earth observation archives. To unlock trustworthy AI scientists, we need new corpora that capture experimental intent, instrument telemetry, lab notebooks, design-build-test loops, and the sociotechnical context around them. The AI Scientists workshop therefore hosts a dataset proposal competition focused on resources that democratize autonomous discovery.

Sponsored by [Renaissance Philanthropy](http://www.renaissancephilanthropy.org), the competition will award a total of USD $10K to the most compelling proposals. Winning teams will present their vision during the ICML workshop and can engage with Renaissance Philanthropy about potential follow-on funding for data collection.

Submissions will be judged on:
1. **Scientific value** – Does the dataset unlock a high-impact question or application?
2. **Feasibility & openness** – Can the community realistically build and share it under open licenses or appropriate access policies?
3. **Breadth of impact** – Will the dataset serve multiple research areas or underrepresented communities?
4. **Path to execution** – Are there concrete plans for sourcing, cleaning, and maintaining the data (including privacy and safety considerations)?

**What your proposal must cover**
- AI task definition – What scientific question will the dataset enable? Is it a prediction, generation, or other task?
- Dataset rationale – Why is this dataset the bottleneck? Describe the data type(s), scale, resolution, and labels/metadata needed.
- Acceleration potential – How will access to this dataset transform model development and downstream science?

**Recommended (optional) details**
- Data-creation pathway – Where will the data come from? (e.g., public archives, new experiments, shared simulation pipelines, privacy-preserving consortia).
- Cost & scalability – Rough budget or strategy for cost-effective generation at scale, including new automation or sensing platforms.
- Risk assessment – Plans for handling safety, privacy, biosafety, or dual-use concerns.

# Important Dates (Anywhere on Earth)
- Submission Deadline: Apr 5, 2026
- Submission Revision Deadline: Apr 12, 2026 (you may continue updating your proposal until this date)
- Acceptance Notification Date: Apr 26, 2026

# Submission Instructions
- Length: 2 pages of main text max — unlimited space for references and appendices
- Submission site: [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2026/Workshop/AI4Science)
- Anonymity: All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well. If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing.
- Format: We will use the ICML 2026 LaTeX template (link forthcoming; no ICML checklist is required for workshop submissions).

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Who can submit?**
Anyone—researchers, practitioners, students, or independent contributors—from anywhere in the world is welcome to apply. An academic affiliation is not required.
- **How many authors can a submission have?**
You may apply as a sole author or as part of a team. There is no upper limit on the number of co-authors.
- **Will my submission be made public?**
Yes. Accepted dataset proposals will be published on OpenReview. If you prefer your proposal to stay private, email ai4sciencecommunity@gmail.com after acceptance and we will coordinate an alternative.
- **Using the ICML 2026 template**:  
When submitting, please compile with the double-blind ICML 2026 style option. After acceptance we may request a camera-ready version with the “final” option enabled. Update the template footnote to “Submitted to the AI for Science workshop (ICML 2026).”
