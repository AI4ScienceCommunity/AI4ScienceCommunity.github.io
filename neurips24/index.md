# About

Dramatic developments in AI have led to its increasing adoption in science as a means to model complex phenomena, generate hypotheses,
design experiments, collect and interpret large datasets, and gain new insights that might not have been possible using traditional scientific methods. The main goal of this series of workshops is to discover synergy across a variety of scientific fields, encourage
interdisciplinary discussions, and enhance the flow of knowledge between AI and various scientific communities. Throughout history,
bridging seemly different fields has brought overarching benefits, with notable examples: entropy in thermodynamics and information
theory, neuroscience and AI, and algorithms inspired by discoveries in science (e.g. genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and diffusion-
based generative models). In the current era, successes of AI methods in different fields of science have alluded to the general effectiveness
of common themes: large simulated datasets, enforcing problem symmetries, and foundation model architectures. Our mission is to bring
more scientists to attend ICML to share different perspectives on the use of AI and to illuminate exciting research directions for AI
researchers.

# Open Catalyst Challenge

The Open Catalyst Challenge invites participants to help address the pressing challenges faced by the world due to energy scarcity and climate change. In this area, a critical problem is the discovery of new catalysts for driving efficient and carbon-neutral means for energy storage and conversion.

Over the past two years, the Open Catalyst Challenge has focused on the central task of relaxed (local minimum) energy prediction. This year’s task of determining the adsorption energy (global minimum) will require relaxed energy prediction as a subtask.
