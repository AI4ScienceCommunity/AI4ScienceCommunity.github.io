# Call for Papers
We call for two types of submissions. The first is the \textit{Original Research} track, where we solicit 4 page extended abstracts. We introduce a second novel *Attention* track, where we solicit 2 page submissions that are open to scientific problems and overlooked assumptions of ML methods. All submitted papers will be non-archival, rigorously reviewed double-blind by at least 3 reviewers, and we will use mechanisms provided by the CMT to appropriately handle any conflicts of interest. 

Area of Interest (including but not limited to):
- Learning physical dynamics from data
- Speed up physical simulators, samplers and solvers
- Extracting physical insights from data
- Automating physics rediscovery and discovery
- Predicting molecular properties or bioactivities
- Generative modeling and de novo designing molecules
- Modeling chemical reactions and retrosynthesis
- Simulating molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry 
- Modeling protein, RNA structures and dynamics
- Modeling biological systems
- Analyzing genomics and diseases
- Benchmarking related or new tasks (i.e. datasets, sota models, etc.)
- Building tools/infrastructures/platforms for scientific discovery 
- Other scientific discovery or application fields, such as earth science, environmental science, mechanical science , aerospace science, management science, agricultural science, material science, nuclear science etc.
