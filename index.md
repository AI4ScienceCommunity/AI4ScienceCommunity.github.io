# About

For centuries, the method of discovery—the fundamental practice of science that scientists use to explain the natural world systematically and logically—has remained largely the same. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) hold tremendous promise in having an impact on the way scientific discovery is performed today at the fundamental level. However, to realize this promise, we need to identify priorities and outstanding open questions for the cutting edge of AI going forward. We are a series of workshops that facilitate the development of AI for Science with the identified gaps from the [1st AI for Science workshop](neurips21.html) held with NeurIPS 2021 and theories and foundations from [2nd AI for Science workshop](icml22.html) with ICML 2022, progress and promises from [3rd AI for Science workshop](neurips22.html) with NeurIPS 2022, from theory to practice from [4th AI for Science workshop](neurips23.html) with NeurIPS 2023, scaling in AI for scientific discovery from [5th AI for Science workshop](icml24.html) with ICML 2024 and the upcoming reach and limits in AI for scientific discovery from [6th AI for Science workshop](neurips25.html). We look forward to meeting you (again) in our future events. Let us know if you have any feedback through [email](mailto:ai4sciencecommunity@gmail.com).

## News

We are launching a new initiative to collect AI for Science related papers published year by year. We started by collecting from major ML conferences and we are calling for volunteers to contribute either missing papers or missing collections! Check out or contribute here [link](https://github.com/sherrylixuecheng/AI_for_Science_paper_collection)!

Our blog "[AI for Science in 2024](https://medium.com/@AI_for_Science/ai-for-science-in-2024-a413a083ad43)" is now live!

Our blog “[AI for Science in 2023: A Community Primer](https://medium.com/@AI_for_Science/ai-for-science-in-2023-a-community-primer-d2c2db37e9a7)” is now live! In this blog, we delve into how AI intersects with various scientific fields - from Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer/Math. Science, Neuroscience to Earth Science.

## Nature Review Paper


Excited to share our [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06221-2) on the role of AI in scientific discovery.
