# About

<!--Machine Learning has largely advanced technology and changed people’s life in all aspects, spanning from entertainment, transportation to medical healthcare, and begun to tackle challenges in scientific disciplines, from studying dynamic systems, learning protein structures to designing new molecules. Machine Learning methods have demonstrated great promise in modeling and processing various types of scientific data as well as accelerating scientific discovery. -->

<!--However, the areas of focus are distinct in the machine learning and the scientific communities. Thus, mutual understanding between the two communities needs to be improved (e.g. the scope and limit of machine learning techniques, the foundations of the scientific problems, etc.). To reach this goal, it is necessary to have a dialogue between the two communities which can make machine learning have impacts on real-world scientific discovery problems. -->

Machine learning has revolutionized a wide array of scientific disciplines and solved problems that were unsolvable before: predicting protein structure, imaging black holes, automating drug discovery, and so on. 

However, the areas of focus are distinct in the machine learning and the scientific communities. While ML researchers strive for methodology advances, they often make assumptions that keep realistic utilities futile; similarly, scientific communities pose crucial but unsolved problems but they are not formulated in the ML language and thus overseen by the ML communities. 

This gap limits the advance of science with AI. Thus, it is of tremendous importance to form a dialogue between the two communities. This workshop is born with this idea --- bridging the gap between AI and science. 

The primary goals of this workshop are as follows:
- Point out **current gaps** between AI and Science, (1) current investigated directions by ML researchers that are not effective in real-world scientific discovery, (2) current ML methodology can be largely improved with first principles from scientific perspectives, (3) the science areas with the most potential for ML to jump in.
- Bring researchers who are interested in AI for Science together, including but not limited to AI, ML, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science, Material Science, Environmental Science, Aerospace Science, and Mechanical Science, and so on.
- Promote interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations from two dimensions, not only across AI and Science, but also within each of the ML and scientific fields.
- Bring more people into the fields, share interdisciplinary research experience, and provide mentorship opportunities for students.

Program Highlight:
- Panel discussion about Frontiers, Gaps, and Futures in AI for Science, given by ML and Science researchers.
- Invited talks on grand challenges in AI for Science, real-world practices in AI for Science, and guidance on AI for Science.
- Call for attention which offers opportunities for researchers to call attention from the community on a specific scientific problem.
- Mentorship program and roundtable experience sharing to build the community and bring more young people into the fields.

<!--Additionally, many scientific challenges require knowledge of more than one scientific field. For example, protein structure prediction requires knowledge from biology, chemistry, and physics. The success of AlphaFold2 also benefits from a team with diverse backgrounds. Thus, a platform which promotes discussions and collaborations in the general scientific communities is needed. -->

<!--The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in tackling scientific problems with machine learning methods and industry experts with practical experience about the applications of machine learning and scientific discovery (e.g. pharmaceutical and material industry). -->
