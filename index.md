# About

Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized a wide array of scientific disciplines and solved problems that were unsolvable before: predicting protein structure, imaging black holes, automating drug discovery, and so on. Despite this promise, we observe the following gaps that stifle advancement:

+ **Gap 1: Unrealistic methodological assumptions or directions.** While ML researchers strive for methodology advances, they often make unrealistic assumptions that limit real-world adoption. For example, most state-of-the-art molecule generation ML models generate molecules that have low synthesizability.

+ **Gap 2: Overlooked scientific questions.** Scientific communities contend with crucial and unsolved problems but they are not formulated in the ML language and can thus be overlooked by the ML communities. For example, how can theoretical physical laws be parameterized to re-discover or discover new ones?

+ **Gap 3: Limited exploration on the intersections of multiple disciplines.** Solutions to grand challenges often stretch across multiple disciplines. For example, protein structure prediction requires collaboration across physics, chemistry, biology; single-cell imaging of whole-tumor can be approached by cosmology algorithms that connects cells as stars. 

+ **Gap 4: Science of science.** The principles of scientific methods have been unchanged since 17th century. How AI can facilitate the practice of scientific discovery itself is often undiscussed. For example, instead of the multiple hypothesizing-experimenting cycles to make sense of a phenomena, can AI reason and output nature laws directly?

However, little work has been done to bridge these gaps, mainly because of the missing conversations among the scientific communities. While we see many workshops focus on AI for individual scientific discipline, they all focus on method advances in a single field and are unable to answer the above important questions. Thus, this workshop is born to fulfill this unmet need. Particularly, the goal of this workshop aims to bridge each of the above gaps via:
+ Identify the directions that are currently used by ML researchers that are not effective for real-world scientific discovery. 
+ Bring important scientific questions with untapped potential for use of ML methodological advances to the AI community. 
+ Pinpoint grand challenges at the intersection of various scientific fields (biology, chemistry, physics, neuroscience, etc).
+ Highlight how ML can change or complement the classic scientific methods and facilitate the science of scientific discovery itself.

<!--Machine Learning has largely advanced technology and changed people’s life in all aspects, spanning from entertainment, transportation to medical healthcare, and begun to tackle challenges in scientific disciplines, from studying dynamic systems, learning protein structures to designing new molecules. Machine Learning methods have demonstrated great promise in modeling and processing various types of scientific data as well as accelerating scientific discovery. -->

<!--However, the areas of focus are distinct in the machine learning and the scientific communities. Thus, mutual understanding between the two communities needs to be improved (e.g. the scope and limit of machine learning techniques, the foundations of the scientific problems, etc.). To reach this goal, it is necessary to have a dialogue between the two communities which can make machine learning have impacts on real-world scientific discovery problems. -->

Machine learning has revolutionized a wide array of scientific disciplines and solved problems that were unsolvable before: predicting protein structure, imaging black holes, automating drug discovery, and so on. 

However, the areas of focus are distinct in the machine learning and the scientific communities. While ML researchers strive for methodology advances, they often make assumptions that keep realistic utilities futile; similarly, scientific communities pose crucial but unsolved problems but they are not formulated in the ML language and thus overseen by the ML communities. 

This gap limits the advance of science with AI. Thus, it is of tremendous importance to form a dialogue between the two communities. This workshop is born with this idea --- bridging the gap between AI and science. 

The primary goals of this workshop are as follows:
- Point out **current gaps** between AI and Science, (1) current investigated directions by ML researchers that are not effective in real-world scientific discovery, (2) current ML methodology can be largely improved with first principles from scientific perspectives, (3) the science areas with the most potential for ML to jump in.
- Bring researchers who are interested in AI for Science together, including but not limited to AI, ML, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science, Material Science, Environmental Science, Aerospace Science, and Mechanical Science, and so on.
- Promote interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations from two dimensions, not only across AI and Science, but also within each of the ML and scientific fields.
- Bring more people into the fields, share interdisciplinary research experience, and provide mentorship opportunities for students.

Program Highlight:
- Panel discussion about Frontiers, Gaps, and Futures in AI for Science, given by ML and Science researchers.
- Invited talks on grand challenges in AI for Science, real-world practices in AI for Science, and guidance on AI for Science.
- Call for attention which offers opportunities for researchers to call attention from the community on a specific scientific problem.
- Mentorship program and roundtable experience sharing to build the community and bring more young people into the fields.

<!--Additionally, many scientific challenges require knowledge of more than one scientific field. For example, protein structure prediction requires knowledge from biology, chemistry, and physics. The success of AlphaFold2 also benefits from a team with diverse backgrounds. Thus, a platform which promotes discussions and collaborations in the general scientific communities is needed. -->

<!--The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in tackling scientific problems with machine learning methods and industry experts with practical experience about the applications of machine learning and scientific discovery (e.g. pharmaceutical and material industry). -->
